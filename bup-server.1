.SH NAME
.PP
bup-server - the server side of the bup client-server relationship
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]bup\ server\f[] is the server side of a remote bup session\.
If you use \f[B]bup-split\f[](1) or \f[B]bup-save\f[](1) with the
\f[B]-r\f[] option, they will ssh to the remote server and run
\f[B]bup\ server\f[] to receive the transmitted objects\.
.PP
There is normally no reason to run \f[B]bup\ server\f[] yourself\.
.SH MODES
.TP
.B smart
In this mode, the server checks each incoming object against the
idx files in its repository\. If any object already exists, it
tells the client about the idx file it was found in, allowing the
client to download that idx and avoid sending duplicate data\.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B dumb
In this mode, the server will not check its local index before
writing an object\. To avoid writing duplicate objects, the server
will tell the client to download all of its \.idx files at the
start of the session\. This mode is useful on low powered server
hardware (ie router/slow NAS)\.

.SH FILES
