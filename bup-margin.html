    >DESCRIPTION</h1
    ><p
    ><code
      >bup margin</code
      > iterates through all objects in your bup repository, calculating the largest number of prefix bits shared between any two entries. This number, <code
      >n</code
      >, identifies the longest subset of SHA-1 you could use and still encounter a collision between your object ids.</p
    ><p
    >For example, one system that was tested had a collection of 11 million objects (70 GB), and <code
      >bup margin</code
      > returned 45. That means a 46-bit hash would be sufficient to avoid all collisions among that set of objects; each object in that repository could be uniquely identified by its first 46 bits.</p
    ><p
    >The number of bits needed seems to increase by about 1 or 2 for every doubling of the number of objects. Since SHA-1 hashes have 160 bits, that leaves 115 bits of margin. Of course, because SHA-1 hashes are essentially random, it's theoretically possible to use many more bits with far fewer objects.</p
    ><p
    >If you're paranoid about the possibility of SHA-1 collisions, you can monitor your repository by running <code
      >bup margin</code
      > occasionally to see if you're getting dangerously close to 160 bits.</p
