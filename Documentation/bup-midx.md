# NAME

bup-midx - create a multi-index (.midx) file from several .idx files

# SYNOPSIS

bup midx [-o *outfile*] <-a|-f|*idxnames*...>

# DESCRIPTION

`bup midx` creates a multi-index (.midx) file from one or more
git pack index (.idx) files.

You should run this command
occasionally to ensure your backups run quickly and without
requiring too much RAM.

# OPTIONS

-o, --output
:   use the given output filename for the .midx file. 
    Default is auto-generated.
    
-a, --auto
:   automatically generate new .midx files for any .idx
    files where it would be appropriate.
    
-f, --force
:   force generation of a single new .midx file containing
    *all* your .idx files, even if other .midx files
    already exist.  This will result in the fastest backup
    performance, but may take a long time to run.

--max-files
:   maximum number of .idx files to open at a time.  You
    can use this if you have an especially small number of file
    descriptors available, so that midx can complete
    (though possibly non-optimally) even if it can't open
    all your .idx files at once.  The default value of this
    option should be fine for most people.


# EXAMPLE

    $ bup midx -a
    Merging 21 indexes (2278559 objects).
    Table size: 524288 (17 bits)
    Reading indexes: 100.00% (2278559/2278559), done.

# DISCUSSION

By default, bup uses git-formatted pack files, which
consist of a pack file (containing objects) and an idx
file (containing a sorted list of object names and their
offsets in the .pack file).

Normal idx files are convenient because it means you can use
`git`(1) to access your backup datasets.  However, idx
files can get slow when you have a lot of very large packs
(which git typically doesn't have, but bup often does).

bup .midx files consist of a single sorted list of all the objects
contained in all the .pack files it references.  This list
can be binary searched in about log2(m) steps, where m is
the total number of objects.

To further speed up the search, midx files also have a
variable-sized fanout table that reduces the first n
steps of the binary search.  With the help of this fanout
table, bup can narrow down which page of the midx file a
given object id would be in (if it exists) with a single
lookup.  Thus, typical searches will only need to swap in
two pages: one for the fanout table, and one for the object
id.

midx files are most useful when creating new backups, since
searching for a nonexistent object in the repository
necessarily requires searching through *all* the index
files to ensure that it does not exist.  (Searching for
objects that *do* exist can be optimized; for example,
consecutive objects are often stored in the same pack, so
we can search that one first using an MRU algorithm.)

With large repositories, you should be sure to run
`bup midx -a` or `bup midx -f` every now and then so that
creating backups will remain efficient.
