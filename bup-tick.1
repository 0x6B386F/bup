.TH bup-tick 1 "2011-01-02" "Bup 0\.20-32-g6eedafc"
.SH NAME
.PP
bup-tick - wait for up to one second
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup tick
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]bup\ tick\f[] waits until \f[B]time\f[](2) returns a different
value than it originally did\. Since time() has a granularity of
one second, this can cause a delay of up to one second\.
.PP
This program is useful for writing tests that need to ensure a file
date will be seen as modified\. It is slightly better than
\f[B]sleep\f[](1) since it sometimes waits for less than one
second\.
